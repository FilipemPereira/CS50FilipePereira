# Lecture 5 - Unit Tests

Problem set 5:

1. Testing my twttr
2. Back to the Bank
3. Re-requesting a Vanity Plate
4. Refueling

To test the programs (to test the tests!), install pytest, a unit test framework for Python using:

~~~
pip install pytest
~~~

To run the tests:

~~~
pytest <name>.py
~~~

Note: The name should have this format `test_<name>.py` to make sure the framework can run the tests.
